# Arcade Game
This is a classic arcade game.


## Rules

* Bugs are your Enemies. 
* Your goal is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
* You can move left, right, up and down. 
* Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. 
* Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
